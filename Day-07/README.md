Today I thought of practicing using String Manipulation and Lists.
But the things I could do were too limited, so I decided to use for loops, while loops, and if, else statements.
practice.py is where I experimented on what some functions do.
In Project folder I made some tiny, simple projects.
Tomorrow I'll practice with...
Hmmm... Lemme check! 
...
...
...
Dictionaries!
I'm allowed to use all the things I have used previously.
I'll use lists, if, else, for, while, string manipulation, etc.

Oh, and today I solved a Leetcode problem!
I checked Leetcode problems for the first time and solved it on my own, it was an easy difficulty one though.
