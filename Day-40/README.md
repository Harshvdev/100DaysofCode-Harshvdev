Day-40 of #100DaysOfCode 


Today I designed the Progress Log section of my new #100DaysofCode website!

- Built it with HTML + CSS only (Haven't learned Js yet)

- Faced some trouble picking colors that matched the gradient background above it

- Ended up using a soft steel blue log area with gradient borders for each day card

- Styled with custom fonts, shadows, and flex layout
