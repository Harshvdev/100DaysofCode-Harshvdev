### July 4 2025:

Day-43:

Today I decided to make an anonymous text-based platform called "HearMeOuttt"
I know I don't have a good naming-sense.
I asked ChatGPT and Gemini how to make it. Never heard of Firebase before. I got started anyway.
Had the most trouble in writing server rules! Took 6 hours of work in total.
Added character-limit and a 5 minute delay between each post for spam-prevention.
