"The properties you need to add to each element are:

div: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
p: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
button: an orange background and a font size of 18px"

But when creating a button without mentioning border-color, it's black. But in the desired result image, it's white. So I added white border color and black text color.
