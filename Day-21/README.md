**Day 21** – #100DaysOfCode

Completed 20% of The Odin Project – Foundations (+10% today)

Today I learned:

- How the internet works: servers, websites, browsers, DNS, IP addresses
- How to set up WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Loving the hands-on, text-based approach so far. Every day feels like I’m connecting the dots more clearly.
