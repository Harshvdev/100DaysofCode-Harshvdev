Day 39 of #100DaysOfCode

I started building a website for my GitHub repo to showcase my progress. Today, I worked on the homepage layout. I added a responsive navbar, set up colors and fonts, and styled the header section.

I will keep updating it daily as I learn and build more.
Here is a screenshot of todayâ€™s progress!
