#100DaysofCode 

**Day-29**

Got introduced to Flexbox in The Odin Project and learned visually from the flexboxfroggy website.

- display: flex goes on the container, not items
- align-items (all) vs align-self (one)
- order changes the visual order without touching HTML (Still don't understand well)
- flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, flex-flow, and align-content

I'll learn more about Flexbox tomorrow!
