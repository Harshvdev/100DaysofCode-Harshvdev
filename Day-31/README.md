#100DaysofCode  – Day 31

Still learning Flexbox with The Odin Project and going through the layout exercises.
I’m finding some parts a bit confusing, so I’ll watch a few visual tutorials tomorrow to get more clarity.

I completed only 5/7 exercises. Left 6th half-way. I'm sleepy. It's 11:52 PM... I'll complete the rest tomorrow.
I had to see solutions of two of them. Flexbox is confusing.
