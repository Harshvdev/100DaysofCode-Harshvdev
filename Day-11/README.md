#100DaysOfCode - Day 11 Update

Completed 15 beginner Python questions to continue sharpening my coding skills.

Day 2 of Touch Typing Practice:

Day 1: 9.5 WPM, 88% Accuracy

Day 2: 35.6 WPM, 93% Accuracy

I'm excited about the progress I've made! Typing faster and improving Python every day. Looking forward to seeing how I can continue growing.
