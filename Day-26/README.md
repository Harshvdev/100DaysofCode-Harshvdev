Day 26 of #100DaysOfCode

- Learned about cascading in CSS and how style priority works

- Box model: margin, padding, borderâ€”everythingâ€™s a box ðŸ“¦

- box-sizing: border-box made layouts cleaner

- Got introduced to DevTools & Inspect Element

I couldn't solve the cascading exercise in The Odin Project, but I'll revisit it tomorrow.
