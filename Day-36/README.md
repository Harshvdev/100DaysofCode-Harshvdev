Day 36 – #100DaysOfCode

• Revisited CSS by building a navbar from scratch
• Reviewed key JavaScript string methods: .charAt(), .at(), .trim(), .length
• Installed and set up Node Version Manager (nvm)
• Progress: The Odin Project Foundations → 68%

I haven’t been able to code for the past few days due to CUET exams, now back to consistent learning!
